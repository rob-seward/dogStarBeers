Hells Larger
* STYLE: Lager
* PRICE: £1.42
* ABV: 4.6%
* HOPS: Perle, Hallertauer Tradition
* MALT: Pilsner
* INGREDIANTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAIL: What the Hells? Thanks for asking. Hells is the lovechild of our two favourite German beer styles - Helles and Pilsner. Classic, crisp and refreshing. It's the beer we always wanted to drink and the reason we started our brewery. We hope you agree

Pale Ale
* STYLE: Pale Ale
* PRICE: £1.64
* ABV: 4%
* HOPS: Pilsner, Wheat, Light Crystal, Munich
* MALT: Perle, Simcoe, Citra
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAIL: We love our American cousins. But sometimes they can be kind of full on. So we've crafted this beer to more British Tastes. Hoppy, fruity and dry, ours is a drinkable 4%. Made with American hops, its still got all the punch of a pale ale. Just less shouty.

Show Off Larger
* STYLE: Lager
* PRICE: £1.25
* ABV: 5.8%
* HOPS: Magnum, Chinook, Simcoe, Mosaic
* MALT: Pilsner, Carapils, Munich, Wheat
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAIL: The look-at-me lager. Lager's typecast as refreshing, but capable of so much more. We're proud to show off all the things our favourite beer style can be. Crisp and clean, of course, but also hoppy and juicy, just like this little number. Ta-Da!

Off Menu Ale
* STYLE: India Pale Ale
* PRICE: £1.80
* ABV: 5.8%
* HOPS: Simcoe
* MALT: Pilsner, Extra Pale, Cara, Wheat, Aromatic
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* Detail: Our ideal IPA wasn’t on the menu, so we made it. Resisting piling up a variety of hops like toppings on a burger, we held the pickles and did things our way. Sandwiching together light malts, clean Cali ale yeast, and early harvest Simcoe hops. Just what the Brewers ordered.

Harvest Hells
* STYLE: Lager
* PRICE: £2.0
* ABV: 4.6%
* HOPS: Perle, Hallertauer Tradition
* MALT: Pilsner, Munich, Cara Red, Cara
* Aroma, Carafa Special III
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAILS: Harvest is hard work for farmers and a busy time of year for the rest of us. Rush through and it’ll be winter already, so enjoy this plentiful season by sharing some of said plenty and – if you aren’t operating agricultural machinery – a beer. We suggest this rich, robust version of Hells, made in appreciation of autumntime.

Hells in Hibernation
*STYLE: Unfiltered Lager
* PRICE: £1.25
* ABV: 4.6%
* HOPS: Apollo, Chinook, Simcoe
* MALT: Pilsner, Wheat, Rye
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAIL: A wintery take on our classic Hells Lager. Hazy, unfiltered and brewed with Apollo and Chinook hops to give this beer its piney spice aromas and citrus freshness. Not like an air freshener but more like a stroll amongst the spruce back to your log cabin, A cosy woodland hibernation in beer form.

Bock Larger
* STYLE: Bavarian Bock Lager
* PRICE: £1.90
* ABV: 6.5%
* HOPS: Perle, Spalt, HBC472
* MALT: Pilsner, Munich, Aromatic, Crushed Crystal, Chocolate, Carafa Special Type 3 
* INGREDIENTS:  Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, Yeast
* DETAIL: This Bock is (mostly) brewed in true Bavarian style, cold fermented slow to bring out balance between light hops and dark malt. But we did add experimental hop HBC472 for bonus bourbon and vanilla oakiness akin to barrel aging, which old school Bavarian brewers might frown on, but we think it tastes pretty good.

Hoopers Tropical Larger
* Style : Lager
* PRICE: £1.50
* ABV : 4.4%
* HOPS: Perle & Citra, with Green Mango Powder and Lemon Peel 
* MALT: Pilsner, Munich, Wheat
* INGREDIENTS: Malted Barley, Wheat, Hops, Water, yeast, Green Mango Powder and Lemon Peel
DETAIL: This is our collaboration with Hoppers - brewed to go with everything from Hoppers and Sodas to Kothu, Rice and Roasts. It's fresh and crisp, with added lemon peel and fruity green mango powder - perfect for pairing with all the Sri Lankan flavours and spices at Hoppers.
